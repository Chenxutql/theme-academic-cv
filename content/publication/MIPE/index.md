abstract: The purpose of this study is to develop a control method for walking assistive robot that enables the elderly to keep positive emotions and maintain high levels of motivation during exercise. In this study, a control method based on emotion recognition and fatigue detection was proposed. We used brainwave and heartbeat signals to train a deep neural network (DNN) model to recognize human emotions. Portable near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) was used to detect muscle fatigue. Furthermore, we established a 3D human state model to evaluate the userâ€™s emotional and fatigue states. We also performed experiments to evaluate the ability of the control method to improve the effect of walking exercise.
